# YOLOv5-OpenPose

You can utilize YOLOv5's real-time object recognition capabilities within the MediaPipe framework by combining YOLOv5 with MediaPipe. With this setup, you may create computer vision apps that use the CPU to compute while processing video streams or webcam inputs and performing real-time object detection. Without the need for specialist hardware or dedicated GPUs, the YOLOv5 + MediaPipe pipeline can run on a wider range of devices by using the CPU.

With the added bonus of CPU compatibility, the YOLOv5 + MediaPipe combo offers a versatile and effective solution for real-time object detection tasks, making it appropriate for a range of computer vision applications.
